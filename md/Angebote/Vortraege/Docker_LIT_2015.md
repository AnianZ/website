### Kurzbeschreibung
Docker is an open-source project that automates the deployment of applications inside software containers, by providing an additional layer of abstraction and automation of operating-system-level virtualization on Linux. Docker uses resource isolation features of the Linux kernel to allow independent "containers" to run within a single Linux instance, avoiding the overhead of starting virtual machines.
