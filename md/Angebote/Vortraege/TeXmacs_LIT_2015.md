### Kurzbeschreibung
GNU TeXmacs is a free _wysiwyw_ (what you see is what you want) editing
platform with special features for scientists. The software aims to provide a
unified and user friendly framework for editing structured documents with
different types of content (text, graphics, mathematics, interactive content,
etc.). The rendering engine uses high-quality typesetting algorithms so as to
produce professionally looking documents, which can either be printed out or
presented from a laptop.The software includes a text editor with support for
mathematical formulas, a small technical picture editor and a tool for making
presentations from a laptop. Moreover, TeXmacs can be used as an interface for
many external systems for computer algebra, numerical analysis, statistics,
etc. New presentation styles can be written by the user and new features can be
added to the editor using the Scheme extension language.Documents can be saved
in TeXmacs, XML or Scheme format and printed as Postscript or PDF files.
Converters exist for TeX/LaTeX and HTML/MathML.
